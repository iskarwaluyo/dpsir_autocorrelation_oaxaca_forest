<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework can be used to analyze interactions between society and the environment, including for forest socio-ecological systems, such as ones in Oaxaca, Mexico. In this paper, the DPSIR framework was operationalized through indicators obtained from Inegi, Semarnat and Conafor: the economic value of agricultural activities and population were considered Drivers (D), surfaces used for agricultural activities were considered Pressure(P), current land use and vegetation coverage was used to describe State (S), timber and non-timber production was considered Impacts (I) and payments for ecosystem services (PES) were considered Response (R). Values per municipality of each of the indicators allowed estimating the spatial autocorrelation (Moran´s I) between indicator groups. Results suggest that municipalities with agricultural and livestock activity are mostly located in municipalities that border Veracruz and in certain parts of the Costa. Municipalities with more timber production are located in the Sierra Norte (Ixtlan de Juarez, Santa Catarina Ixtepeji, San Pablo Macuiltianguis). In Oaxaca, there are no trade-offs between forestry and agricultural and livestock activities. Results are indicative of the effects of PES that promote forest conservation in Sierra Norte and patterns of agriculture and livestock near borders which may be indicative of trade activities.
